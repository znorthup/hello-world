# hello-world
My first github repository!

My name is Zack and I'm a Cal Poly student studying information systems.
My favorite color is red, and I love The Old Spaghetti Factory. Hopefully by the end of taking BUS 392, I'll be able to write a program that can help me keep track of my friends and family's birthdays!
